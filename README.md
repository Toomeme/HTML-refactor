# HTML and CSS Code Refactor

In this project, the goal was to refactor an existing codebase to meet industry-standard requirements of accesibility, readability, and SEO. I have accomplished this by incorporating semantic HTML elements as well as consolidating duplicate CSS rules and classes. This not only future-proofs the website, but helps any potential collaborators. To this end, I have also added comments as well as formatted the code with proper indenting to follow the logical page structure. 

## Requirements

This project was made using VS code and is maintained through Git, ideally, any collaborators would conform to this standard, however, Adobe Dreamworks or any similar IDE would be sufficient. 

## Files and Directiories

The file system for this project should be self-explanatory, it is asset light at this time.
